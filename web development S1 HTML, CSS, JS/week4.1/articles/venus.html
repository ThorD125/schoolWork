            It's been a while — like, forever — since anyone claimed to have discovered life on Venus.<br />
            And truth be told, the scientists who announced on Sept. 14 the discovery of phosphine, a gas, in Venus's atmosphere did not claim to have discovered life, either — only that they could not think of anything that might have produced it other than microbes in the clouds. “We're not saying we discovered life on Venus,” Sara Seager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in an interview a few days before the announcement.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On Earth, anyway, the only natural source of phosphine is microbes; the gas is often associated with feces. But it would hardly rank as a surprise to find out that scientists don't know everything there is to know yet about the geochemistry of Venus, our nearest but rarely visited neighbor in the solar system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Nor would it be the first time that the search for life on another planet has foundered on ignorance of the local
            chemistry. Experts still argue whether some experiments on the Viking landers in 1977 detected signs of life on
            Mars, but the main lesson from that adventure was that scientists had tried to run on Mars before learning to
            walk there: They went looking for <a href="#">Martian biology</a> before they had mastered Martian chemistry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One of the strengths of science is that interpretations can turn on a dime with the addition of more data. In the
            case of Venus, opinion has turned and turned again.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the mythology that served as the narrative backbone of <a href="#">classic science fiction</a>, Venus was often portrayed as a
            cloudy, swampy rain forest kind of planet — a water world, a plantation world, humid but habitable, in some
            accounts even inhabited by docile natives. Mars was a dying, desert civilization — a vision promoted in the
            early 20th century by the Bostonian philanthropist Percival Lowell, who thought he could see canals on Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was long before either place was actually visited and their inhospitable natures revealed: Venus with its
            crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere, surface temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and sulfuric acid clouds; Mars
            with its frozen wisp of an atmosphere. Both of them bone dry, at least on their surfaces.
