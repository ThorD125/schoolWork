This exercise deliberately has no lengthy document to guide you, forcing you to make your own conclusions and estimations. This exercise does not need to be handed in, but you are free to add it to your git repository as the week 3.1 folder. 

Tips:

Fonts:
* Georgia,Cambria,'Times New Roman',Times
* 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial

Colours etc need to be derived from the end result (you have many tools for this at your disposal)
Margins, font sizes, ... are determined by approximation

* the containing element has a fixed width of 60rem

Consult your final result in Chrome, Firefox en Edge. What are the differences? 

GLHF!
