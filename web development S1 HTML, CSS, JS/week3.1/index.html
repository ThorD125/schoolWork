                <h2>How to avoid you office job weighing on your health</h2>
                <p>No matter how much you enjoy doing your job, work can start to weigh heavily. Stress, excessive sitting, staring at a screen for a long time: many daily habits eat into your well-being without you picking up on it. With the help of The Guardian, we've gathered ten tips for keeping you healthier and fitter at work.</p>

            <p>No, we won't tell you to stop working. Having a job is better for your health than not having one: work gives a person purpose and structure, creates human contact and wages allow you to pay for a <span>healthier lifestyle</span>. And yes, this article covers Western 'first world problems', because there are countries where working is still several times more uncomfortable.</p>
            
            <p>Yet that Western job can make us sicker than we think. Diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, back problems and psychological complaints such as burnouts are <span>disorders becoming increasingly common in the West</span>. However, you can help prevent them with some relatively simple adjustments to your habits. The Guardian listed ten for you:</p>
          
            <ol>
                
                <li>
                    <h2>Get up every so often</h2>
                    <p>In Flanders we <a href="#">spend an average of 9 hours seated</a> on a chair or sofa. Sitting too much and for too long is deceptively unhealthy. Recent research shows that those who stay stationary for large parts of the day, have a highier risk of heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes, depression and premature death.</p>
                    
                    <p>Walking around every 20 to 30 minutes makes a difference. If your job doesn't allow you to stand a lot, try doing some muscle exercise from time to time while sitting. For example, tighten your abdominal muscles, contract your buttocks and pelvic floor muscles, stretch and bend your legs.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h2>Take that break outside</h2>
                    <p>First, take the coffee or lunch break you are entitled to. Don't sit even when it's busy. Breaks benefit your work. <a href="#">Research shows</a> that the most productive employees take a 17-minute break every 52 minutes (intensive work). That may be impossible in your job, but you can try to approximate</p>
                    
                    <p>Secondly, if you do take a break, why not go outside even if it were to rain a little? Leave those funny YouTube videos or those private emails for what they are. Fresh air, some oxygen, also means a generous portion of fresh energy and keeps you alert. And suddenly you're on the move!</p>

                <li>
                    
                    <h2>Take the stairs, ignore the elevator</h2>
                    <p>Climbing stairs is a free workout during your working day. Make use of it.</p>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Look around</h2>
                    <p>68 percent of Generation Y (the generation born between 1982 and 2001) stare at a screen for nine hours or more every day, and so do one third of Generation X (born between 1961 and 1980). Small or unclear images force our eyes to focus. You also blink a lot less when constantly looking at a screen, which makes your eyes dry and tired.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sounds familiar? <a href="#">Simple tip:</a> stop looking at the screen at least every twenty minutes and try to focus on a spot in the distance for at least 20 seconds. This will improve your concentration.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h2>Cut down on the caffeine</h2>
                    <p>Coffee dehydrates and caffeine makes you sleep worse. We already informed you that neither of these is good for your health. You should therefore consider cutting back.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nevertheless, the conclusions regarding the adverse effects of coffee are not all that conclusive. <a href="#">We've collected all potential advantages and disadvantages of black gold for you here.</a></p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Be positive and helpful</h2>
                    <p>Well-being is a mental issue as much as it's a physical one. Try to <a href="#">approach difficult situations in a positive way</a>. And be altruistic, honest and sincere, it will improve your self-worth. An interesting side effect is that it can also help you advance in your career.</p>
