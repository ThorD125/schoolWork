Complete all of these these smaller flex exercises first, before the more complicated "wearables" example, allowing you to play with the flex properties in an isolated environment. 

These exercises do not need to be handed in and not all techniques touched here are present in the "wearables" example, though several of the techniques touched here might be present on the November exam. 

What do we expect: 

1) Recreate the given examples in code. All of the basic styles have been supplied, all you need to do is add the flex specific CSS code in the style block in each HTML file. Note that adding code in a style block is for the modular purpose of this exercise only and should never be applied in production


Start with the small-layouts, then move on to large-layouts challenges 

2) As a playful way of getting to know flex box and specifically, the box alignment specification, veel free to complete the Flex Froggy quest on  http://flexboxfroggy.com/ 


GLHF!
