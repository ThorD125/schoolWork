This exercise deliberately has no lengthy document to guide you, forcing you to make your own conclusions and estimations. This exercise does not need to be handed in, but you are free to add it to your git repository. 

Always (!) use git + commits, even when not handing in your exercises. 

Tips:

* Write down on paper what you're going to do for each question, BEFORE you do it. Without a plan, you have no direction
* No modifications to the HTML nor CSS are needed, aside from linking your JS. Do look at both files though. They contain valuable hints
* These are in fact 2 separate exercises: one with a "flat" array of strings, another with an array of objects. Do not attempt the second before finishing the first 
* You might need to refactor your code several times before getting it right, that's no problem. Commit regularly so you can retrace your steps if necessary 
* Make sure you only have **one** function that renders HTML. Reuse the same one for every list you display/modify
* You will need a regular expression in one of the functions. Don't be overwhelmed, what we're looking for is something very simple. Brilliant resource to help you with regex: https://regex101.com/
* Try to abstract the search functionality inside the .forEach() in a separate function
* Try using the .filter() function for the search, after having tried with a forEach()
* The ideal solution for this has between 8 to 12 functions

Some function names we used, as a hint: 

* init
* fillDrinksList
* stripSpaces
* sortList
* toggleSort
* changeButtonText
* find
* containsDrink
* sortByName (object array only)

Try using the same ones


GLHF!
