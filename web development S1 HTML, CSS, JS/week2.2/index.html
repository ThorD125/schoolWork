            <h3>Recipes</h3>
            <p>We take pride in serving you fresh recipes on a regular basis. Our recipes <strong>adjust over the seasons</strong>, using only products that are growing in your garden at that very moment. We also try to include <strong>fresh spices of the moment</strong> or dry spices from earlier harvests. Happy cooking!</p>

            <h3>Seeds</h3>
            <p>Our seeds are all organically grown and harvested, <strong>no preservatives or pesticides</strong> were added. We encourage our users to harvest their own share every season and couple back to the organisation, to increase the amount of local sub breeds in our offer. Every seed you buy has a <strong>traceable origin</strong>, so you are in full control of your production cycle.</p>
