# Area of a disk (circle)
Write a program that reads the radius of a circle (``float``),
and computes and prints the area up to 3 digits after the decimal point.
You can ignore negative radiuses by treating them as regular radiuses.

You can display 3 numbers after the decimal point by using
`format(math.pi, '.3f')`.

**Hint:** In Python you can represent Ï€ by using ``math.pi``.
To use ``math.pi``, however, one needs
to import ``math`` first. (This is done for you in this file)

import math  # do not remove this line

radius = float(input("insert radius of circle"))

result = format(radius ** 2 * math.pi, '.3f')

print(result)
